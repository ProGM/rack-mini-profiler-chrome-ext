Rack Mini Profiler -  Chrome Extension
=====

An early-stage development chrome extension to make it easier to work with [rack-mini-profiler](https://github.com/MiniProfiler/rack-mini-profiler) on APIs.


# How it works

It adds a ruby icon that becomes bright when the current web page has some profiling infos.

Clicking it will take you to the Mini Profiler result page.


# Development tools

It adds a (raw) console extension to capture all requests having profiling informations. You can access them by clicking `ctrl+shift+j` or `cmd+alt+j`.
